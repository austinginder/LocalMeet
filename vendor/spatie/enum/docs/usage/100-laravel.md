We provide a [spatie/laravel-enum](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-enum) wrapper package with some advanced options tailored for Laravel.

The most important difference is the extended `Spatie\Enum\Laravel\Enum` base class which is required for the model casting.

In short the wrapper adds the following features:

* Model Attribute casting
* Request Validation Rule
* Request Data Transformation
* Artisan Make Command
* Faker Provider
